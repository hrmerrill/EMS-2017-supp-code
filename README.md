# Supplementary Code for: Forecasting Urban Water Demand with Statistical and Machine Learning Methods Using Large Space-Time Data

This repository provides an example data set and code for fitting the models in the 2017 EMS paper. The C++ code provides the functions necessary for training the ST model and using the model to make forecasts. The R scripts simulate some example data and fit and validate the corresponding model.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. You can then change simulation settings or use the model on your own data set.

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), with packages `caret`, `mgcv`, `fields`, `Rcpp`, and `RcppArmadillo` installed
* [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (for Windows; other systems may need other compilers, e.g. [here](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-os-x/))

### Installing

Once the prerequisites above have been installed, you simply need to copy the files in this repo to your local machine.

### Running the code

This code should be able to be run as-is, either line-by-line or all at once.
